#+title: org-slide.el

Embed simple slideshows into your ~org-mode~ files.

[[file:./example.gif]]

Implemented using org-mode [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Dynamic-Blocks.html][dynamic blocks]]. *Note that this package is not
designed as a way to create presentations*.

* Installation
Put ~org-slide.el~ into one of the folders given by ~load-path~ and add to your
emacs config file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org-slide)
#+END_SRC

* Usage
Call ~org-dynamic-block-insert-dblock~ (bound to ~C-c C-x x~) and choose ~slide~. The
following block will be inserted:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+BEGIN: org-slide :id "slideshow-name"
1st slide...
# SLIDE
2nd slide...
# SLIDE
3rd slide...
#+END:
#+END_SRC

Type out your slides in normal org-mode with every slide separated by the
delimiter ~# SLIDE~. Every delimiter has to be on its own line.
# TODO or use your own delimiter by changing the string passed with ~:delimiter~@@.

Press ~C-c C-c~ (or call ~org-dblock-update~) with the point on the line containing
~#+BEGIN: org-slide~ to start going through the slides.
